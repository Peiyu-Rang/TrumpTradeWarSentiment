Pos,"Juncker is set to meet President Donald Trump on Wednesday as the U.S. considers whether to impose trade tariffs on vehicles and auto parts. 'He will be making suggestions there about how we can enter into a discussion process to avoid this,” Merkel said at her annual summer press conference. Juncker will “present possibilities for discussion' to the U.S. president, Merkel said."
Pos,"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that the United States and Mexico were making progress on a trade deal, and warned Canada he would tax their auto exports if an agreement cannot be reached with Ottawa. 'Deal with Mexico is coming along nicely. Autoworkers and farmers must be taken care of or there will be no deal. New President of Mexico has been an absolute gentleman,' Trump said on Twitter. 'Canada must wait. Their Tariffs and Trade Barriers are far too high. Will tax cars if we can’t make a deal!' he said."
Pos,"U.S. President Donald Trump spoke warmly of Mexico’s incoming leftist president on Monday, saying he expected to get 'something worked out' on NAFTA, while a top Mexican official said there was scope to revive the trade talks this week. 'We’re talking to Mexico on NAFTA, and I think we’re going to have something worked out. The new president, terrific person,' Trump said in a speech at the White House about American manufacturing."
Pos,Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tells CNBC that U.S. trade negotiations with the European Union formed the basis of a 'real agreement' to reduce tensions. Mnuchin says the goal is the eventual elimination of all tariffs and in the nearer term no additional tariffs and a removal of duties on steel and aluminum.
Pos,"'Kim Jong-un is making terrific progress,' Trump told supporters on Thursday. 'For nine months, no nuclear tests, no rockets are going up, no missiles are going over Japan.' On June 12, Trump and Kim met in Singapore during their first official summit meeting. The two officials signed an agreement saying North Korea will denuclearize in exchange for a freeze on the US-South Korean military drills and potential sanctions relief. The White House did not specify any deadlines on carrying fulfilling the agreed on items."
Pos,"Xi’s remarks – his first public comments since Beijing and Washington began sparring over tariffs – at first appeared conciliatory. He pledged to further open up China’s financial services sector, lower tariffs on car imports, encourage other imports and better protect intellectual property – the latter issue being one of the key grievances of Donald Trump’s White House."
Pos,"The United States and Mexico are edging closer to agreement on how to rewrite key portions of the North American Free Trade Agreement, with the two countries making progress on rules related to automobiles and other remaining issues during two days of meetings that ended on Friday in Washington. A preliminary agreement between Mexico and the United States would go a long way toward accomplishing President Trump’s goal of revising the quarter-century-old trade pact, which he has frequently criticized as the worst trade deal ever. But talks this week have excluded the pact’s third member, Canada, leaving significant issues unresolved. "
Pos,"President Trump said Wednesday that he had reached an agreement with the European Union for both sides to end all tariffs on industrial imports from the other side, easing fears about a widening trade war. Standing in the White House Rose garden with Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, Trump called it a “big day for free and fair trade.”"
Pos,"President Trump scored his first significant trade deal this week, securing a pact with South Korea that represents the type of one-on-one agreement that Mr. Trump says makes the best sense for American companies and workers. The deal, which is expected to be formally announced on Wednesday, opens the South’s market to American autos by lifting existing limits on manufacturers like Ford Motor and General Motors, extends tariffs for South Korean truck exports and restricts, by nearly a third, the amount of steel that the South can export to the United States. Mr. Trump used his threat of stiff steel and aluminum tariffs as a cudgel to extract the concessions he wanted, helping produce an agreement that had stalled amid disagreements this year."
Pos,"High-level Nafta negotiations are resuming this week after a two-month hiatus for Mexico’s July 1 presidential elections. While the nations had said progress was made earlier this year, the pact’s future hangs in doubt. Trump last week repeated his threat to pursue individual deals with Mexico and Canada, and the three nations still remain far apart on major points almost a year after the negotiations first began."
Neg,"U.S. and Chinese trade relations are getting nastier, as the U.S. threatened to bump up its proposed 10 percent tariffs to 25 percent on $200 billion in Chinese goods. The threat came as progress appears to be made in U.S. talks with Mexico toward a new North American Free Trade Agreement, which would be a much needed win for the Trump administration. China ramped up its own rhetoric, saying it would retaliate if the U.S. does not stop escalating the trade war."
Neg,"'We clearly have a chronic problem with China,' U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in Senate testimony, estimating that trade issues with Beijing will take years to resolve. He said the Trump administration believes it must push back against China because it uses “state capitalism” to take advantage of the openness of the U.S. economy, costing Americans jobs and wealth."
Neg,North Korea issued a forceful statement Thursday against what it said were elements of the US government which are not adhering to the spirit of the dialogue established by US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the Singapore summit hin June.
Neg,"This month, Trump threatened to levy tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese products, a move that, coupled with fees already approved, would hit nearly half of China’s shipments to the United States. The administration says Beijing steals American trade secrets, discriminates against foreign companies and subsidizes state-backed enterprises in a way that warps global commerce."
Neg,"A day after announcing steep tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on Friday that 'trade wars are good, and easy to win'."
Neg,"If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!"
Neg,"""The EU has been particularly tough on the United States. They make it almost impossible to do business with them, and yet they send their cars and everything else back into the United States,"" Trump said while standing next to the prime minister of Sweden, a country known for its Saabs and Volvos. ""We can put a tax of 25% on their cars and believe me they won't be doing It for very long,"" he said. "
Neg,"President Trump has indicated that he's willing to hit every product imported from China with tariffs and again criticized the Federal Reserve, as well as some of the United States’ biggest trading partners. In a taped interview with the business channel CNBC, Trump said “I'm willing to go to 500,” referring to the approximately $505.5 billion worth of goods imported last year from China."
Neg,"In a tweet, Trump said he had “just authorized a doubling” of tariffs against Turkey, upping those on aluminum to 20% and steel to 50%. The U.S. imports about $1 billion in steel and aluminum from Turkey, so the direct impact is not likely to be substantial. But the ripple effects were considerable as the Turkish currency, the lira, plummeted on the news, pushing the country closer to a full-blown economic crisis, and dragging the euro down sharply on Friday."
Neg,"Chinese yuan slides, spooking Asian stocks, as trade war fears heighten. Worries about a full-blown global trade war are likely to persist as officials from the EU Trade Commission, due to arrive in Washington next week for trade talks, are said to be preparing a list of tit-for-tat actions in response to proposed U.S. tariffs on EU cars."
Neg,"Responding to the latest tariffs levied by the Trump administration, China announced 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion in U.S.-made goods. That included the roughly $10 billion in automobiles that Chinese motorists were expected to purchase this year. The impact could be significant considering that American-made vehicles were previously saddled with 25 percent tariffs upon reaching Chinese ports."
Neg,"President Trump's tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods kick in, escalating a war of words between the world's two largest economies into a full-blown trade conflict. Washington's 25 percent duties went into effect at midnight EDT and affected products such as water boilers, X-ray machine components, airplane tires and various other industrial parts. China immediately retaliates with tariffs on its $34 billion list of goods issued last month, including soybeans, pork and electric vehicles. Beijing calls it the ""biggest trade war in economic history."""
Neg,"National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told Fox Business Network today that the US and Europe “will be allied” against China a day after Trump and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker announced an agreement to work toward a free trade agreement. Kudlow said China had “broken the world trading system” and that Junker “made it clear” Wednesday that the EU would back the Trump administration’s efforts to curb trade abuse from Beijing. “They’re not the only ones but the world trading system is broken with high tariffs and barriers and technological stealing and IP theft,” Kudlow said of China."
Neg,"Talk that U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports could increase further amount to “blackmail” from the Trump administration that will prompt retaliatory measures from Beijing, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry said Wednesday. “U.S. pressure and blackmail won’t have an effect. If the United States takes further escalatory steps, China will inevitably take countermeasures and we will resolutely protect our legitimate rights,” Geng Shuang, the spokesman, told reporters at a briefing Wednesday, according to Reuters."
